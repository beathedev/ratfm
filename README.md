My project is a Flask web application that allows users to view their last five played tracks and their most played track in the past month. The application uses the Last.fm API to fetch user data, such as recently played tracks and top tracks of the last month, and displays them in a user-friendly format. The front-end of the application was built using HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templates, while the back-end logic was implemented using Python and the Flask framework. The Last.fm API requests were made using the Requests library, and the data was parsed and transformed using the Pandas library. The application also includes error handling and caching mechanisms to improve performance and user experience. Overall, the application provides a quick and easy way for Last.fm users to keep track of their listening habits and discover new music.
